# Atomic testset for  IFC transition bends

Example files for six alignment transition bend types as defined in IFC (CLOTHOID, HELMERTCURVE, BLOSSCURVE, COSINECURVE, SINECURVE, VIENNESEBEND)

For each type eight variations of start curvarture and end curvature are provided.

For each of the 48 atomic testcases the following files are available:

- one Excel Report
- five different version of an IFC-File with schemaversion IFC4X3_ADD2 (ISO-Standard as of start of  2024)
	- horizontal layout only
	- horizontal layout with check data
	- horizontal layout and vertical layout (no check data)
	- horizontal layout and vertical layout with check data
	- check data only
- one plot containing 2D x/y diagram, curvature diagram, cant diagram

Note 1: the vertical layout consist of a simple line with gradient 0
Note 2: IFC Files with cant layout can be expected soon
